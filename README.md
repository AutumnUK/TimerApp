# TimerApp
It wouldn't be a portfolio without it.
This was my first project where I had to manage a database of any kind or use python.

The idea behind this is that if I spend an hour on an activity it levels up. A level up grants 1xp.
Enough xp and my character levels up.

It's something I managed to put together in 2 days from scratch, however there's a lot I'd like to change and improve. There will be a version 2 eventually.
